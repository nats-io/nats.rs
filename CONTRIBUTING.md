# Contributing

Hello there and welcome!

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before making a change to avoid duplicate or un-warranted work.

## Pull Request Process

- We use linear history, please make sure your commits are atomic.
- Do your best to keep commits to a reasonable size, split out into a different pull request for tangental changes that are observable externally.
- Write well formed commit messages (e.g [Example](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html))
- Do call out if you start working on an issue and raise pull requests early for visibility to avoid duplicate work.
